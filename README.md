# K-Means
A matlab implementation for the unsupervised learning algorithm ( K-Means).

The program implements the K-Mean algorithm on three different datasets. For further information about the topic, you can take a look at **topic.pdf**.

You can run the program by calling the KMean function with one of the datasets and the value K. 

```
K = 5
KMean(importdata('path_to_dataset.txt'),K)
```
